*Lets first run a basic two way anova;

proc glm data=monkey;
class Treatment Memory Week;
model NewPerCorrect=Treatment Week Treatment*Week;
estimate 'What is this contrast?' Treatment -1 1 Treatment*Week -.5 -.5 0 0 0 .5 .5 0 0 0;
lsmeans Treatment*Week / pdiff tdiff adjust=Tukey;
run;

*Note the combination order to help you with the contrasts is
  Treatment "Control" "Treatment"
  Week 2 4 8 12 16;

*Now, we know that we have repeated measures on the same monkey and thus correlated data.
Let's see what happens if we try to handle that in proc mixed using a repeated statement;
*The type=CS option is the compound symmetry assumption Dr.  McGee's video mentions.  We will discuss this in more detail later;

/* 3.	Based on what you know about 2way anova, is there an interaction?
Also, to get at one of the researcherâ€™s questions, figure out the contrast
that would test for the difference in mean percentage between Treated and 
Control groups specifically for Week2. */

Include the contrast in both of the procs and compare the result.  Are they the same, if not
what is different? */
